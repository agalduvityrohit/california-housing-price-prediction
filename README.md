# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction

This project uses the **California Housing dataset** (from the 1990 California census) to build a **Linear Regression model** that predicts median house prices based on features like income, house age, rooms, population, and location.

It includes:
- Real-world dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Model training & evaluation
- Visualizations (saved in a `plots/` folder)
